    "In the last exercise in the Dask Delayed notebook, we wrote a function which used `dask.delayed` to parallelize loading multiple CSV files into a Pandas DataFrame. In this notebook, we'll introduce and use Dask's DataFrame interface to automatically build similiar parallel computations for tabular data computations. Dask DataFrames look and feel like Pandas DataFrames, but they run on the same infrastructure that powers `dask.delayed`.\n",

    "Dask DataFrames are partitioned along their index into different **partitions** where each parition is a normal Pandas DataFrame. These Pandas objects may live on disk or on other machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask DataFrames implement a well-used portion of the Pandas API which are backed by blocked algorithms that allow for parallel and out-of-core computation. In particular, Dask DataFrames support:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Elementwise operations: `df.x` + `df.y`, `df * df`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Row-wise selections: `df[df.x > 0]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loc: `df.loc[4.0:10.5]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common aggregations: `df.x.max()`, `df.max()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is in: `df[df.x.isin([1, 2, 3])]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Datetime/string accessors: `df.timestamp.month`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Froupby-aggregate (with common aggregations): `df.groupby(df.x).y.max()`, `df.groupby('x').max()`\n",

    "\n",
    "For many purposes Dask DataFrames can serve as drop-in replacements for Pandas DataFrames. Much like the Dask Delayed interface, Dask DataFrames are lazily evaluated. You can use use the DataFrame API to automatically build up a task graph representing complex computations and then call `compute()` to to evaluate the graph in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use Dask DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is great for tabular datasets that fit in memory. If your data fits in memory then you should use Pandas. **Dask becomes useful when the dataset you want to analyze is larger than your machine's RAM** where you would normally run into `MemoryError`s.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "During this tutorial, the example NYC dataset we're working with is only about 200MB so that you can download it in a reasonable time and exercises finish quickly, but Dask Dataframes will scale to datasets much larger than the memory on your local machine. Furthermore, as we'll talk about in the next notebook, Dask's distributed scheduler allows you to run the same DataFrame computation across a cluster."
